# Linear Regression for Liver Steatosis Data

This is a course project material for Linear Regression modeling. A best linear model is sought for a Liver Steatosis dataset. While a logistic regression would be a better fit for a binary classification, per a course requirement, a best linear model is used, optimized and its performance evaluated.
